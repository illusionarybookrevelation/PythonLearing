# In Hell We Live,Lament(feat.KIHOW)
#### Mili
I walked down a path &nbsp; Leading to the past <br>
Stole from the tree's hands &nbsp; A regretter's friend --- the forbidden fruit <br>
I bite off the skin &nbsp; Chewing on its tender flesh <br>
Quaff down its lukewarm pus &nbsp; You became the "me" who you despised <br>
We swallowed the time &nbsp; Let us rewind <br>
Lament &nbsp; If you wanted me to speak <br>
If you wanted me to think &nbsp; If you wanted me to carry on out dreams <br>
Each loop we live through(Each loop we live through) <br>
The standards inside me,the line I drew for me &nbsp; Lowers to the earth <br>
Lament &nbsp; Why'd you make my voice stutter? <br>
Why do truths never matter? <br>
Why'd you curse me with "you're a natural born genius"? <br>
Endless inferno(Inferno) &nbsp; Counter-clock we rose <br>
Counter-clock we reload <br>
