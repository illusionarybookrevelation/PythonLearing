# In Hell We Live,Lament(feat.KIHOW)
#### Mili
I walked down a path &nbsp; Leading to the past <br>
Stole from the tree's hands &nbsp; A regretter's friend --- the forbidden fruit <br>
I bite off the skin &nbsp; Chewing on its tender flesh <br>
Quaff down its lukewarm pus &nbsp; You became the "me" who you despised <br>
We swallowed the time &nbsp; Let us rewind <br>
Lament &nbsp; If you wanted me to speak <br>
If you wanted me to think &nbsp; If you wanted me to carry on out dreams <br>
Each loop we live through(Each loop we live through) <br>
The standards inside me,the line I drew for me &nbsp; Lowers to the earth <br>
Lament &nbsp; Why'd you make my voice stutter? <br>
Why do truths never matter? <br>
Why'd you curse me with "you're a natural born genius"? <br>
Endless inferno(Inferno) &nbsp; Counter-clock we rose <br>
Counter-clock we reload <br>
Tick tick tock <br>
Replayed thoughts &nbsp; Forget me not <br>
I'm inside the empathic light &nbsp; I bite off your skin <br>
Exposing the angels on your ribs &nbsp; They stare at  us <br>
Hello,how may I help you today? &nbsp; Please,a one-way ticket to heaven <br>
Buckled up on velvet seats &nbsp; Sceneries were passing by <br>
Not so different from our hell &nbsp; Not so different from our home <br>
Then I realized <br>
Someone's heaven could be the source of my torment <br>
Life is allowing yourself &nbsp; Allowing yourself to step on fire,shed tears on bloodied routes <br>
Life is to consume &nbsp; Life is to become food for each other,no matter evil or good <br>
Lif is fairness,life is inequality &nbsp; Eternally in hell we live <br>
Life is in the motion & By default <br>
Lament <br>
If you wanted me to live &nbsp; If you want me to forgive <br>
If you want us to pretend like we're civilized humans <br>
Each loop we die through(Each loop we die thought) <br>
The justice inside me,the ego fending me &nbsp; Rationalize my sin <br>
Lament <br>
Why do deaths end my torture? &nbsp; Why can't anyone feel my hurt? <br>
Why'd you crown the most violent to be champions? <br>
In this inferno(Inferno) &nbsp; We built for ourselves <br>
Reviving each other in this hell lyrics
